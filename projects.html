          <p>
            Nick Morris is an iOS, Web, Java, and Python developer in addition to a
            particle physist and engineer. He began his career at Kenny's Burger Joint
            where he initially only hosted and ran food. But he later developed an
            iOS App and pitched it to the CEO of the chain who later purchased the app.
            Not long later, Chris Tynes,CTO of StoneEagle, offered him a paid internship
            where his career really took off. Nick plans to graduate from
            Jesuit College Prepatory School of Dallas, to attend Texas A&M University
            where he hopes to study Computer Science and Particle Physics.
